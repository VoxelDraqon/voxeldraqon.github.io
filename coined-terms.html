            <p>These are some terms I have coined myself. Most are also viewable on the <a href="https://lgbta.wikia.org">LGBTA Wiki</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="Aslangender">Aslangender <img src="images/flags/Aslangender.png" height="60" width="100"></h2>
            <p>Aslan is a character from the Chronicles of Narina by C.S. Lewis. He is a depiction of Jesus in the form of a sapient, talking lion. Aslangender is a gender that feels fully xenic or outherine, but also fully male, female, or neutral. This is similar to how Jesus is said to have been fully man and fully god.<br>
            Aslangender can also refer to a gender that feels like the fabric of the universe or has connections to lions, Narnia, the fantasy genre, and/or religion/spirituality.<br>

            <h2 id="Dracogender">Dracogender <img src="images/flags/Dracogender.png" height="60" width="100"></h2>
            <p>Dracogender is a xenogender tied to dragons. This can manifest in multiple possible ways: an otherkin person's kintype is a dragon and this is their kingender; a person's gender feels large, scaly, winged, and possibly related to fire or water; a person's gender feels like a literal dragon.<br>
            This gender can also be combined with other gendered terms to make things such as dracoboy or femdracogender.<br>

            <h2 id="Hardwaregender">Hardwaregender <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lgbta/images/7/72/Hardwaregender.png" height="60" width="100"></h2>
            <p>Hardwaregender is a xenogender defined by a connection to computer hardware, such as circuit boards, wires, and CPUs. It may also involve a connection to a specific type of computer, in which case it can overlap with <a href="https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/OSgender">OSgender</a>.<br>

            <h2 id="Smeagender">Sméagender <img src="images/flags/Smeagender.png" height="60" width="100"></h2>
            <p>Sméagender is a xenogender linked to the character Sméagol/Gollum from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. It feels almost like a person, but not quite, or like it was a person but isn't anymore. It feels small and animalistic and controlling, and reminds one of dark, damp things, and long, thin fingers. It feels like it had been around for a very long time and knows too much, but is weak at the same time. It is like the devil on your shoulder.<br>
            A Sméagender individual may feel more comfortable referring to themselves as we/us, despite being one person.<br>

            <p>Sociagender, YouTubegender, or Tubegender is a xenogender and technogender connected to or influenced by YouTube, Twitch, other video sharing/streaming platforms, and/or the communities/cultures surrounding them. It can also be used to refer to a xenogender that relates to the content/persona of a specific content creator or the community surrounding them.<br>
